## Motivation

In modern entertainment and research you are pretty much always being controlled by "algorithms" they know the best what is good for you, and choose what you have to see, of course, you may find something valuable online, but the risk is that this mysterious algorithm will decide that is is not worth informing you about related news or posts, then you will probably forget what it was and that it exists.

You can prevent it by simply using an RSS aggregator, where YOU decide what is worth your time and what you want to read/listen about.
